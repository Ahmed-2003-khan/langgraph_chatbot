# LangGraph Learning Repository

This repository contains my practice code and learning journey with LangGraph.

## Purpose
- Practice LangGraph concepts and patterns
- Build various graph-based applications
- Document learning milestones through Git commits

## Workflow
When I complete a new LangGraph concept or milestone, I use the `/push` command which:
1. Analyzes my code changes
2. Adds educational comments explaining the concepts
3. Commits with a descriptive learning message
4. Pushes to GitHub
5. Removes comments locally to keep workspace clean

This way, my Git history becomes a self-documenting learning log!

## Structure
- Each commit represents a learning milestone
- Commits contain educational comments explaining LangGraph concepts
- Local workspace stays clean for ongoing practice
